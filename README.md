## Assignment 1

### Assigment 1a
Vertex shader (vs): Responsible for processing individual vertices, including transformations and passing data to the fragment shader.
Fragment shader (fs): Determines the color output for each fragment based on interpolated attributes received from the vertex shader.
The solution:
1- Adjust light position and direction in vertex shader "vs".
2- outColor is the final color output of the fragment shader so Lighting calculations are performed, including diffuse and specular reflections, to determine the final color.
### Assigment 1b
The Solution:
1- In vs: we replace the fixed values in Light position with parameters "we took those paraneters from defaultMaterial", I add those parameter to the user interface in Matierials Tab so the user can change them as he want.
2- We can also change ambient, diffuse, specular and shininess from the same interface after we add those parameters to fs shader as parameters.
3- we add "x_position,y_position,z_position" to the interface in util.js file.
