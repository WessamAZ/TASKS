## Assignment 1

### Assigment 1a
Vertex shader (vs): Responsible for processing individual vertices, including transformations and passing data to the fragment shader.
Fragment shader (fs): Determines the color output for each fragment based on interpolated attributes received from the vertex shader.
The solution:
1- Adjust light position and direction in vertex shader "vs".
2- outColor is the final color output of the fragment shader so Lighting calculations are performed, including diffuse and specular reflections, to determine the final color.
